= Sniffy

== Overview

Sniffy is a Java profiler which shows the results directly in your browser.
It also brings profiling to your unit (or rather component) tests and allows you to disable certain outgoing connections for fault-tolerance testing.
It can even record network traffic sent via Java plain old Socket API as well as via NIO API.

=== In-browser profiler

=== Asserting number of queries in unit tests

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-junit/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/junit/usage/JUnitOverviewTest.java[tags=JUnitOverview]
```

=== Testing bad connectivity

Discover all outgoing network connections from your server and disable them right from your browser:

Sniffy will throw a `java.net.ConnectException` when your application tries to connect to address disallowed by Sniffy.
It's also possible to specify a fixed delay for all sent and received TCP packets.

=== Simulating no connectivity in unit tests

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-junit/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/junit/usage/DisableConnectivityOverviewTest.java[tags=DisableSocketsOverview]
```

=== Recording network traffic

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-core/src/test/java/io/sniffy/socket/CaptureTrafficOverviewTest.java[tags=CaptureTrafficOverview]
```
