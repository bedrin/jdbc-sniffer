== Integration with Spring Framework

Sniffy comes with a http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/[Spring Framework] via `SniffySpringTestListener` spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#testcontext-tel-config[@TestExecutionListener].
Just add `@TestExecutionListeners(SniffySpringTestListener.class)` to your Spring test class and place appropriate expectations on your test methods like shown below.

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-spring-test/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/spring/usage/SpringUsageTest.java[]
```
<1> - Integrate Sniffy to your test using `@TestExecutionListeners(SniffySpringTestListener.class)`.
<2> - Now just add `@SqlExpectation` annotation to define number of queries allowed for given method.
<3> - Just add `sniffy:` in front of your JDBC connection URL in order to enable sniffer.
<4> - Do not make any changes in your code - just add the `@TestExecutionListeners(SniffySpringTestListener.class)` and put annotations on your test method.
<5> - Add `@DisableSockets` annotation on your test method or test class and any attempt to open a network connection will fail
<6> - All socket operations executed within test method annotated with `@DisableSockets` will throw a `java.net.ConnectException`

=== @SharedConnection - rolling back all JDBC transactions started within a test

Sniffy provides convenient annotations for shared connection data source in Spring unit tests.
Consider example below:

```java
include::../../../../sniffy-test/sniffy-spring-test/src/test/java/io/sniffy/test/spring/usage/SpringSharedConnectionUsageTest.java[]
```
<1> - Integrate Sniffy to your test using `@TestExecutionListeners(SniffySpringTestListener.class)`.
<2> - `@EnableSharedConnection` will automatically wrap all your data sources with `SharedConnectionDataSource`
<3> - `@SharedConnection` annotation will make the current connection (started because of `@Transactional` annotation before each test) as master
<4> - Insert two rows into table using master connection
<5> - Another slave connection obtained in another thread will still see the results of these inserts although the isolation level is `READ_COMITTED` and master transaction has not been committed

=== @DisableSocketsGlobally - disabling all network connectivity in a spring application

You can disable all network communications in your spring test (or in fact even in your spring application should you have such a use case) using a dedicated annotation.
```
@DisableSocketsGloballyConfiguration
```

This annotation works before the beans of your application are initialized, so it will capture and disable all network connections.

=== Troubleshooting

1. Spring test context is no longer loaded when I add `@TestExecutionListeners(SniffySpringTestListener.class)`

The reason is that by default Spring does not merge the test execution listeners.
Using this configuration you're removing the predefined listeners which initialize the context.
Change the _mergeMode_ parameter to _MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS_ as shown below:

```java
@TestExecutionListeners(value = SniffySpringTestListener.class, mergeMode = MERGE_WITH_DEFAULTS)
```
